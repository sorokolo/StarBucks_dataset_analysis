# StarBucks_dataset_analysis
# Overview
This my capstone project that consisted in prediction the type of offer that should be given to a customer at Starbucks


# Motivation
I chose to work on this project as part of my capstone project. I chose the StarBucks case study, first because of my interest in understanding customer behaviors at StarBuck. Lastly, I chose this project because I found that it will be very interesting to have a machine learning model that can actually predict what offer should be given to a specific StarBucks customer.

# Packages
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit learn


# File in the repo Descriptions

A data.zip that contain:
  1.  portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.).
  2.  profile.json - demographic data for each customer.
  3.  transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.

Credits must be given to Udacity for the starter codes and Starbucks for provding the data used by this project.

# Summary of the result 
This project allowed me to capture interesting facts about StarBucks customers.
I was also able to create an algorithm that predicts the type of offer at a 82% accuracy
